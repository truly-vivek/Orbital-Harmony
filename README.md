# Orbital Harmony

Orbital Harmony is a simple and visually captivating simulation of the Earth and Moon orbiting the Sun. Built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript, this project demonstrates the beauty of celestial mechanics in a responsive and interactive way.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The simulation adjusts to the size of your browser window.
- **Realistic Animation**: Smooth animation of the Earth orbiting the Sun and the Moon orbiting the Earth.
- **Interactive Background**: A starry background adds depth and realism to the simulation.

## How It Works

The project uses HTML5 Canvas to render the Sun, Earth, and Moon. The positions of the Earth and Moon are calculated using trigonometric functions (`Math.cos` and `Math.sin`) to simulate their orbits. The animation is powered by `requestAnimationFrame`, ensuring smooth and efficient rendering.

### Key Components

- **Sun**: A stationary yellow circle at the center of the canvas.
- **Earth**: A blue circle orbiting the Sun.
- **Moon**: A gray circle orbiting the Earth.
- **Stars**: Randomly placed white dots to create a starry background.

## Code Overview

The core logic of the project is in the `<script>` tag of the HTML file. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Canvas Setup**: The canvas is dynamically resized to fit the browser window.
2. **Celestial Bodies**: The Sun, Earth, and Moon are drawn using the `arc` method.
3. **Animation**: The `animate` function updates the positions of the Earth and Moon and redraws the scene for each frame.
